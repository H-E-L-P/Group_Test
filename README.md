Group_Test
==========

Simple exercise to get everyone in a group collaborating

Things to do:
*  Check you have git on your laptop
*  Create a Github account
*  Link Git with your Github account (see https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/ for tips)
*  Clone the `Group_test` repository `git clone https://github.com/pdh21/Group_Test.git`
*  Create a new branch `git checkout -b NAME_OF_BRANCH` 
*  Edit the successful_collaborators file so that it prints your name
*  Add changes `git add successful_collaborators`
*  Commit changes (with a sensible commit message) `git commit -m 'NAME succesfully added name'`
*  Push branch to GitHub `git push origin NAME_OF_BRANCH`
*  Merge branch with the master branch (see http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging for tips)
